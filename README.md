# OneShotLearning
My try at the One-shot learning algorithm using Tensorflow2

## Getting Started
### Make sure you have all the python libraries already installed before running.
Required libraries are:
- Tensorflow2 (gpu-version)
- numpy
- pandas
- Opencv

Before running load the model. The model is in My_Model directory.
